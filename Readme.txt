1. Matlab:
	|..slprj
	|..Buck800w_v1.slx
	|..Buck800w_v1.slxc
	|..sd_setup_v1.m

	*.m - parameter file with model settings 
	*.slx - model file with simulation model

2. Power Inductor design - 3D models of the custom inductor. No design calculation is there. 

3. Releases - folder with the ordering files and fabrication outputs and info we had in the moment of the first version ordering.

4. Ver 2 - Folder with materials collected for second version of the converter. There are RFQs, requirements document, sMath file with calculation design and mostly datasheets for cheapest components available.

5. Manual.pdf - communication and pluging in instruction for the board.

6. Project_STM32G4x.zip - STM CPU firmware project.

7. PS800.zip - PC software to debug and manage the board via USART interface.
